# Scientific Calculator Project

This repository contains the project skeleton produced during **Step 2** of the
agreed development plan. The current focus was on establishing the directory
layout, placeholder modules, and dependency manifest before implementing any
functional logic.

## Current Structure
- `app.py` – Entry point placeholder for the GUI application.
- `calculator/` – Package for calculation logic modules.
- `ui/` – Package reserved for GUI components.
- `tests/` – Placeholder automated test suite.
- `docs/` – Documentation placeholders.
- `setup/` – Future distribution/build scripts.
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies for upcoming implementation phases.

Further implementation will occur in subsequent steps of the plan.
