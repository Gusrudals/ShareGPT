# Scientific Calculator Project

This repository hosts a Python-based scientific calculator that now includes
working arithmetic, scientific, and polynomial calculus features. The
implementation is designed to be GUI-friendly while remaining usable as a
standalone calculation engine for automated tests.

## Current Structure
- `app.py` – Entry point placeholder for the GUI application (GUI work pending).
- `calculator/` – Package containing the calculation engine and operation
  modules.
- `ui/` – Package reserved for GUI components.
- `tests/` – Automated regression tests covering the current functionality.
- `docs/` – Documentation placeholders.
- `setup/` – Future distribution/build scripts.
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies for upcoming implementation phases.

## Available Features

- **Basic arithmetic**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
  helpers with input validation.
- **Scientific functions**: trigonometry with configurable angle units,
  exponential, and logarithmic operations.
- **Polynomial calculus**: analytic differentiation and integration for
  single-variable polynomials.
- **Expression engine**: safe AST-based evaluator that supports arithmetic,
  scientific functions, configurable precision, and angle units.

Further GUI work and packaging remain for subsequent steps of the plan.
